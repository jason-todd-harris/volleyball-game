Do not swipe to hit the ball. In order to hit the ball tap the side opposite of where you want the ball to travel. If you want to hit up, hit below the ball, if you want to hit right, hit left of the ball. This is relative to the center of the ball so you can also hit the actual volleyball.

\n \n Multiplayer will work with both Bluetooth and WiFi. For best performance please turn off Bluetooth and use only WiFi. The phones will connect if they are both on the same WiFi network.
